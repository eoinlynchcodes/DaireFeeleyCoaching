                    <h2>Online Physiotherapy Consultations</h2>
                    <p>Why Choose Online? </p><br/>
                <h4>Aisling Feeley - Physiotherapist & Medicine Student</h4>
                <p>
                    In an ever-changing busy word, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find the time to do the
                    things
                    that matter to us most, including looking after our health. Often injury concerns, aches and
                    niggling
                    injuries get put on the back burner.</br></br>
                    Online consultations give you the same expert advice you would
                    expect with in-person sessions, with the added bonus of scheduling at a time that suits your busy
                    lifestyle. Whether you’re looking for injury rehab advice, a second opinion or just to pick the
                    brainsof an experienced chartered physiotherapist, you’re covered.</br>
                    </br>
                    My approach to treatment never changes. I want to educate you and support you on your road to
                    recovery,
                    no matter how big or small your concern may be. Together we’ll work to optimise your health,
                    performance
                    and overall quality of life.

                <h3>Why I choose Physiotherapy?</h3>
                <p>
                    Coming from a sports-mad household, the human body and performance science always interested me.
                    Combined with my love of working with people, Physiotherapy was the perfect option for me.

                <h3>My Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I graduated from University College Dublin in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in
                    Physiotherapy. I
                    completed over 1,000 hours of clinical placement during my four years in UCD, working across a wide
                    variety of settings including adult ICU, paediatric ICU, care of the elderly and neurology.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    After graduating, I worked initially in Primary Care in Roscommon, treating patients of all ages in
                    the
                    Community setting. I then secured a job in a busy South Dublin Hospital. Here I was fortunate enough
                    to
                    gain experience in stroke rehab, acute injury, respiratory physiotherapy and care of the elderly. I
                    also
                    trained in Cardiac Rehabilitation, delivering exercise classes for patients after heart
                    surgery/events.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    I caught the travel bug in October 2018 and moved to New Zealand for 10 months. After obtaining my
                    New
                    Zealand Physiotherapy Registration, I began working in two busy West Auckland private practices. The
                    experience I gained in New Zealand has been invaluable to my physio career as I had the opportunity
                    to
                    work with both elite athletes and members of the general population. After a fantastic time abroad
                    working and travelling, I returned to Ireland in August 2019 after receiving a place to study
                    Graduate
                    Entry Medicine at the University of Limerick. This past year I’ve balanced my Medical studies with a
                    new
                    job, working part-time as a Chartered Physiotherapist in a Limerick city private practice.

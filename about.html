                <i>“Having competed at a top level in my chosen sport of cycling, and having coached individuals
                    in
                    the
                    sport of cycling, I have learned that there is no ‘One size fits all approach’ , every
                    individual is
                    unique in their needs and goals, and this must reflect in their training approach and the
                    coaching
                    service that they receive. Athletes need a coach who will help them grow and progress,
                    someone
                    who can
                    help keep them on track when obstacles arise, a coach who can provide them with the
                    necessary
                    feedback
                    and advice with their training and other areas that can help them reach their end goal. This
                    is
                    my goal
                    with the service I provide, I provide one with all the necessary tools to help them achieve
                    their
                    goals.”</i></br></br>
